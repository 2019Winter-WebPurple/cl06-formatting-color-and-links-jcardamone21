            <p>One Direction is an English-Irish boyband made up of Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik, who left the group in 2015. The band was formed on <i>The X Factor</i> in 2010, after all five of the boys auditioned separately. Guest judge Nicole Scherzinger and regular judge Simon Cowell were responsible for putting the boys together. One Direction ended up getting third in the competition, but they were signed by Simon Cowell to a Syco Records record contract.</p>
            <p>The band made five albums together (<i>Up All Night</i>, <i>Take Me Home</i>, <i>Midnight Memories</i>, <i>Four</i>, <i>Made in the A.M.</i>), went on multiple world tours, and received numerous awards and nominations. Many of their singles and albums debuted at the #1 spot on various charts. There are various documentary style movies and books made about them. The band has received many endorsments and participated in multiple fundraisers and events.</p>
            <p>The band announced they would be going on a hiatus in 2016 to take a break, and they have yet to come back. Meanwhile, all of the members have been making their own music, and pursuing solo careers.</p>
